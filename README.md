# NBA2K Win Rate Prediction
Win Rate Prediction by NBA 2K Ratings Data Analysis with K-Mean and DBSCAN Algorithm

NBA 2K is a series of basketball sports simulation video games developed and published annually since 1999. The premise of each game in the series is to mimic the sport of basketball, more specifically the National Basketball Association. Therefore, researchers want to determine the relationship between NBA 2K's rating system and the actual NBA. Researchers want to use this data to explore new strategic opportunities that can be useful for the companyâ€™s further innovations. This data can also be used for the game players to pick players according to its winning rate accuracy based on the NBA. Data will be analyzed using the K-Means algorithm and the DBScan algorithm which is included in the clustering algorithm group. This study aims to determine whether the winning rate data used on the NBA 2K is accurate enough as the real NBA statistics. This study shows that the K-Means clustering algorithm is more suitable to predict the accuracy of this data. The result shows that the accuracy of the K- Means result is 0.6471 (64.7%) which is higher than the result of DBSCAN with accuracy of 0.0191 (0.02%)
